    <h3>Features of the extension:-</h3>
    <p><b>1. Toggle between most recently visited/opened tabs in all the chrome-windows <span class="highlight-text">(Alt + W)</span></b></p>
        <p class="subParagraphMargin">Let's say when the user has opened many hyper-links each in separate tab by clicking on the search-results of search engine,
          in that case the user can toggle between the most recently opened tab and current tab by just pressing the "Alt + W" hot key most most importantly user gets fallback to it's most recently visited tab when he/she closes the current tab automatically (if one is available in the browsing trace).
        </p>
    <p><b>2. Switch to a tab by tab title/ Any matching tab content in all the tabs <span class="highlight-text">(Alt + E)</span></b></p>
        <p class="subParagraphMargin">
          Suppose that the user has many tabs opened in the chrome-windows and suddenly user want to switch to a tab but he/she isn't exact about which tab here was previously,
          but he/she knews few keywords in that tab in which he/she wants to switch to. So in that he/she could just open the extension-popup which looks for the keyword that you want to search for, provide the keywords that you know your target tab contains those keywords and tick the "Search web pages" checkbox, then all the matching tabs will listed in the search result list below the input field.
          if the user has not ticked the "Search web pages" checkbox button then the searching will happen based on the tabs-title and the matching tabs will be listed in the search-result list below the input field.
        </p>
    <p><b>3. Duplicate & Split tabs into same chrome-window OR into separate chrome-windows(if 2 monitors are available) <span class="highlight-text">(Alt + S)</span></b></p>
        <p class="subParagraphMargin">
          Sometimes we wanted to duplicate the tabs at the ease and split the duplicated tabs into separate chrome-widnows then just press "Alt + S" to duplicate & split into separate windows if two different displayable monitors are available.
          Otherwise for single monitor (like in laptop/notebooks) the duplicate & split will happen the single monitor by dividing the screen into two halfs.
        </p>
    <p><b>4. Toggle the window sizes when duplicated & split into two separate chrome-windows within the single monitor! <span class="highlight-text">(Alt + X)</span></b></p>
        <p class="subParagraphMargin">
          When the user has performed duplicate & split tabs into two separate chrome-windows within the single monitor then post splitting the tabs into two separate chrome-windows the user will have provision to toggle the chrome-window sizes by just pressing "Alt + X" hot key.
          This functionality has been implemented to let the user toggle the focused chrome-window and out for the information that he/she wants to see the focused window and then revert that chrome-window size immidiately to check the corresponding information in the other chrome-window by pressing "Alt + X" again to toggle it's size into maximized state.
        </p>
